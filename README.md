# Project---Hyperloop

•	An online platform where the user can login and make reservations in buses, view booking history , give review on buses , can enquire about the bus service available between different cities.

•	This system also provides an admin login through which an admin can login into the system to add / remove buses , add / remove new routes .In this way the database remains secured and inaccessible to anyone and the data of the users can remain protected and secured.

•	Used HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, WAMP Server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have provided the screenshots of our website along with the php and sql files.

To login on the website--
	USERNAME - user123
	PASSWORD - user123
Or you can register yourself as a new user and view the website.

We have used HTML,PHP,CSS and MySQL to develop our website.And we have used wampServer to locally host our website on our machine.
To use-
	Database name - "project"
	Do change username and password in the php files.
  As I have used wamp server you will need to install wamp server onto your system. Then copy all html and php files into                   C:\wamp64\www\project (make a folder names project and copy everything into it).
  Now change the username password in every php file.(normally the username is "root" and password is "".)
  Also import the database onto your system.
  just open phpMyAdmin and import the "project.sql" file into your system.
  Now to run open a browser and type " http://localhost/project/register.php " . 
  Thank You .
